# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Verb dispatch
`bilbo` SHALL read its first argument as a verb and run that verb. The verbs are `new`, `check`, `recall`, `index` and `setup`. Any other first argument, or no argument, SHALL be a usage error.

#### Scenario: A known verb runs
- **WHEN** an agent runs `bilbo check`
- **THEN** bilbo runs the check verb

#### Scenario: Setup is a verb
- **WHEN** a user runs `bilbo setup --yes`
- **THEN** bilbo runs the setup verb

#### Scenario: An unknown verb is a usage error
- **WHEN** an agent runs `bilbo frobnicate`
- **THEN** bilbo prints a usage message that names the verbs `new`, `check`, `recall`, `index` and `setup` to stderr, exits 2, and creates, changes or deletes no file

#### Scenario: No arguments is a usage error
- **WHEN** an agent runs `bilbo` with no arguments
- **THEN** bilbo prints the usage message to stderr and exits 2

### Requirement: Output streams
stdout SHALL carry only a verb's result. Every diagnostic SHALL go to stderr as a line starting with `bilbo: `. The one exception is the interactive `setup` wizard, which draws its prompts, choices and progress on stderr without that prefix; its result, the step report, still goes to stdout.

#### Scenario: A failure leaves stdout empty
- **WHEN** `bilbo new` refuses a taken topic
- **THEN** stdout is empty and stderr holds a line starting with `bilbo: `

#### Scenario: The wizard draws on stderr
- **WHEN** a user runs `bilbo setup` in a terminal and answers every prompt
- **THEN** the prompts appear on stderr and stdout holds only the step report

#### Scenario: Non-interactive setup keeps the prefix
- **WHEN** `bilbo setup --yes` cannot run `launchctl`
- **THEN** every stderr line starts with `bilbo: `
